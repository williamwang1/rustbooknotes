## 17.2 Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types

we want our library user to be able to extend the set of types that are valid in a particular situation

mock inheritance

define a trait 

implement trait on struct or enum 

then can cast user defined trait into desired struct or enum


## 17.3 Trait Objects Perform Dynamic Dispatch

determine the type when runtime

## 17.4 Object Safety is requered for Trait Objects

methods in trait 

return type is not self
there are no generic type parameters
