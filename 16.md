# Fearless Concurrency

## Using Threads to Run Code Simultaneously


### Creating a New Thread with spawn


### Waiting for All Threads to Finish Using join Handles


### Using move Closures with Threads


## Using Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads


### Channels and Ownership Transference


### Sending Multiple Values and Seeing the Receiver Waiting


### Creating Multiple Producers by Cloning the Transmitter


## Shared-State Concurrency


### Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time

#### The API of Mutex<T>

#### Sharing a Mutex<T> Between Multiple Threads


### Multiple Ownership with Multiple Threads


### Atomic Reference Counting with Arc<T>


### Similarities Between RefCell<T>/Rc<T> and Mutex<T>/Arc<T>


## Extensible Concurrency with the Sync and Send Traits


### Allowing Transference of Ownership Between Threads with Send


### Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with Sync


### Implementing Send and Sync Manually Is Unsafe
